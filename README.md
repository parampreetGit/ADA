# ADA
Collection of ADA compliant html elements and Boostrap components

Refer the html/modal.html file to make the Boostrap modals ADA compliant:
1. focus should be on the "X" or first actionable element within the modal.
2. Screen readers should only read content within the modal when the end user is using up/down arrow keys.
3. Focus should go back to the button which invoked the modal.
